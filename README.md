#  Face Mask Detection using GLCM Features & Random Forest

This project detects whether a person is wearing a mask in an image using **GLCM-based texture features** and a **Random Forest classifier**.

##  Features
- Upload grayscale facial images
- Extract 40 GLCM texture features per image
- Normalize features using Min-Max Scaling
- Train and evaluate a Random Forest model
- Visualize results with confusion matrix and metrics

##  Tech Stack
- Python
- OpenCV
- scikit-image (GLCM)
- scikit-learn
- Google Colab

##  Example Metrics
- Accuracy: 96.7%
- Precision, Recall, F1-score included
- Confusion Matrix heatmap

## Dataset
User-uploaded grayscale images labeled as "masked" or "unmasked".

##  Future Improvements
- Real-time webcam detection
- CNN-based comparison
- Cloud deployment
